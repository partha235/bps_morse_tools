tools and technique's for learning morse code.

After working with windows, I had moved to linux distribution. In linux i found that pyttsx3 library of python is not functioning properly or causing errors. So i made a file [morse5.py file](python_type_practice/morse5.py) with linux package [*espeak*](https://itsfoss.com/espeak-text-speech-linux/) which works fine. Check you have installed espeak package on your system if not then run the command according to your manager like apt,pacman,etc.
